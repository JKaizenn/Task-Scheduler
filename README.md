# Overview

As a software engineer continually seeking to broaden my skills and understanding, I've developed a Task Scheduler with an integrated Calendar. This Java-based application serves as a practical tool to manage daily tasks and events through a user-friendly command line interface. The project aims to reinforce my knowledge of Java's core functionalities, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and user input validation. It has allowed me to experiment with and understand Java's Collection Framework, exception handling, and file I/O operations.

# Development Environment

This application was developed using IntelliJ IDEA, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides advanced capabilities for software development. Java was the primary programming language used in this project, leveraging the Java Collections Framework to manage and organize data effectively.

# Future Work

- **Implement File I/O**: Integrate functionality to save and load events from a file, enabling persistent storage of data.
- **GUI Development**: Develop a graphical user interface using JavaFX to enhance user interaction and accessibility.
- **Expand Event Functionality**: Add features to edit and delete events, improving the scheduler's flexibility and user control.
